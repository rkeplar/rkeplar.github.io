            I earned my Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (BSPA) from Indiana-University Purdue University - Indianapolis 
            (IUPUI) December 2021. I graduated as a Sustainable Management and Policy major with minors in Economics and Communication.
            During my time at IUPUI, I participated as an Alternate Spring Break member where we traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to volunteer with 
            the local nonprofit Global Growers, who create urban gardens for immigrants to grow their native foods. We also spent a 
            day at Cox Enterprises learning about corporate social responsibility and the evolving role of businesses in society.

            When my study abroad to Germany to learn about sustainable building technology was cancelled due to Covid-19, I took the opportunity 
            to apply for a research internship with the Lily School of Philanthropy. It was my first exposure to the data analysis process, including using R,
            and where I found my passion for data, especially data visualizations. I collected data on donations to United Ways and how the money was
             dispersed nationally and culminated the internship with a visualization of charitable giving and receiving by county in Indiana.

             I was eager to learn more about the research process and data analytics, so the following semester I signed up for a research project
             about Community Forestry Initiatives (CFI) in Nepal and India. Specifically, I conducted a literature review on elite capture of programs
             and potential solutions. I assisted with survey design and cleaned the collected data. Through this internship, I gained experience 
             with Qualtrics and Slack as well as learning more about interational envirnomental justice and its intersection with gender and governance.

             Promptly after graduation I began the Google Data Analytics Certificate to solidify my data analysis skills. I completed the Certificate 
             in January 2022. I have refreshed my skills using R, learned SQL through BigQuery, and visualized the data story using Tableau. To view
